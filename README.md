## 🎛 Player Settings

You can customize:

```python
PLAYER_NAMES = ["Red", "Blue", "Green", "Yellow"]
PLAYER_COLORS = ["#ff3b30", "#007aff", "#34c759", "#ffcc00"]
PLAYER_SOUNDS = ["buzzer_red.wav", "buzzer_blue.wav", ...]
```

The “🎛 Set Names” button in the GUI lets you change names directly in the app. You can also replace the `.wav` sound files with your own for personalized victory sounds.

## 🔍 Debugging & Expansion

Set `DEBUG_PRINT = True` to log incoming HID data. This is useful for extending the app to detect **all** button presses on the Buzz! controller (e.g., colored answer buttons) if you'd like to build a full Jeopardy! board interface.

- Game nights with friends or family  
- Competitive team events or fairs  
- Gamified training sessions  
- Community trivia contests

## 🧩 Making Buzz! Controllers Recognizable on Windows

Some Buzz! USB controllers may not be immediately recognized by Windows as input devices. If your controller shows up as an **unknown device** or a **USB hub**, follow these steps to manually assign the correct driver:

### 🛠 Steps to Fix Recognition

1. Open **Device Manager** (`Win + X` → Device Manager)
2. Locate the Buzz! controller (usually listed as an unknown device with a ⚠️ yellow warning icon)
3. Right-click the device → **Properties**
4. Go to the **Driver** tab → click **Update Driver**
5. Choose **Browse my computer for driver software**
6. Select **Let me pick from a list of available drivers on my computer**
7. Choose **USB Input Device (HID)** and click **Next**

After this, your Buzz! controller should appear under **Bluetooth & other devices** as something like:

- `Logitech Buzz (tm) Controller V1`
- `BUZZ`
- or similar

Once recognized as a HID device, it will work seamlessly with QuizBuzz! and other compatible apps.
